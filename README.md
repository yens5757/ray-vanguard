# ray-vanguard
A simple 2D arcade game made with C# and SplashKit framework. Designed the game logic using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Implemented design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and a custom Game Loop.

# How to Play
The game is an arcade game. We use WASD to control where the player ship moves. The player ship can’t move outside the screen. Players can shoot bullets with a Spacebar. When the bullet hits an enemy, the enemy will die and the player will gain 1 point for it. Destroy enough enemies can lead you to the Shop. In the shop, you can upgrade 3 times in total. Then you can enter back into the game. The game also becomes harder and harder. There isn’t an ending to this game, try to get your highest points. The points will be displayed in the ending scene. The ending scene will display when the player got hit by an enemy.

# Spec
The game is updating at 60 fps per second. Which uses a 480x854 screen. A perfect fit for most devices.
